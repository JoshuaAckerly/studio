# TODO (Top-level refactor checklist)

This file is a developer-facing, actionable TODO list for the Noteleks refactor work.
Add or update items as you make progress.

## High-level goals

- [ ] Finish manifest-driven asset loader and remove legacy probing.
- [ ] Ensure Spine and per-frame WebP fallbacks are stable and create animations deterministically.
- [ ] Remove or archive legacy `_512` spritesheet assets from `public/games/noteleks/sprites` (if unused).
- [ ] Add tests for `AssetManager` frame queuing and `LoadingScene` two-stage preload.
- [ ] Clean up and document public build vs dev-mode boot differences; ensure dev server prefers source modules.

## Immediate next tasks (for you)

                                                                                 

- [ ] Inspect `window._NOTELEKS_ASSET_PROBE` in the browser console after load to verify textures and animations.

## Refactor tasks

- AssetManager
  - [ ] Extract animation creation helpers (createAnimation, createAlias) into a small module.
  - [ ] Add unit tests for `queueAssetsFromManifest` behavior.
  - [ ] Remove the fallback timeout or make it configurable via GameConfig.

- LoadingScene
  - [ ] Add clearer two-phase progress UI (stage 1: manifest, stage 2: assets).

- Misc
  - [ ] Add a README that explains the runtime asset-loading strategies and how to rebuild sprite manifests.
  - [ ] Add issue labels and templates in `.github/` to track refactor work.
  - [x] Update documentation to reflect Linux backend setup (remove Windows references)
