Noteleks — Animation export & runtime steps

This document explains how animations and per-frame assets for Noteleks are exported, named, loaded and debugged. It complements the existing Spine README in `public/games/noteleks/spine/README.md` (that file documents Spine file placement and expected animation names).

1) Source / export (Spine)
- Export skeleton JSON (e.g. `noteleks.json`) using Spine's JSON exporter (LibGDX format is used by our Spine runtimes).
- Export atlas (`.atlas`) and the associated sprite sheet image (`.png`). These are placed under `public/games/noteleks/spine/` and the repository already contains an example README there.

2) Per-frame image sequences (optional runtime fallback)
- Our runtime supports using per-frame WebP images as a fallback when a packed spritesheet/atlas is not used.
- Naming convention used by the codebase:
  - Pattern: `Skeleton-<Anim>_<index>.webp`
  - Examples:
    - `Skeleton-Idle_00.webp` ... `Skeleton-Idle_15.webp` (two-digit padded exporters)
    - `Skeleton-Jump_0.webp` (single-digit exporter)
    - `Skeleton-JumpAttack_0.webp` ... `Skeleton-JumpAttack_7.webp`
- Recommendation: choose one consistent exporter convention across animations (either zero-padded two-digit or plain single-digit). The runtime attempts both padded (`_00`) and plain (`_0`) forms.

3) Sidecar JSON / atlas variants
- The packer/export pipeline may emit different sidecar formats:
  - `skeleton_idle_512.json` (legacy name with `_512`), or
  - `skeleton_idle.json` (no `_512`), or
  - `skeleton_idle.phaser.json` (Phaser-style atlas format)
- The runtime will try several variants in this preferred order to reduce 404s:
  - `skeleton_idle.json` / `.phaser.json` (no `_512`) and `.webp` images are preferred over `_512.png`.

4) Spritesheet / packed atlas generation
- We include `tools/make_spritesheet.js` (see `tools/`) to produce a packed spritesheet from exported frames. This produces a spritesheet and a JSON sidecar used by Phaser.
- When possible, prefer using a single packed spritesheet or atlas (fewer network requests and faster GPU uploads).

5) Loader behavior (runtime) — how AssetManager loads animations
- `GameScene.preload()` calls `AssetManager.loadPlayerSpriteSheets(scene, GameConfig)` which:
  - Queues per-frame WebP sequences (via `loadFrameSequence`) for known animations (idle/run/walk/jumpattack/attack1/attack2/jump).
  - Queues one or more atlas/spritesheet candidates (tries WebP variants and JSON sidecars) and also queues image+sidecar JSON keys.
  - After loader `complete` it creates animations from whichever assets were actually loaded (per-frame textures, generated frames from a sidecar JSON, numeric spritesheet grids, or atlas named frames).
- `loadFrameSequence` probes each candidate frame URL using fetch (HEAD, with GET fallback). It currently probes both padded and plain names and will probe up to a configurable probe limit — this causes 404s for indices that don't exist. See suggestions below to reduce those 404s.

6) Debugging & runtime helpers
- Quick diagnostics available in the browser console:
  - `window._NOTELEKS_ASSET_PROBE` — snapshot populated by `AssetManager` with textures and cache keys.
  - `AssetManager.probeSpineState(scene)` — call from console to get a concise probe of cache/textures/plugin state. Example:
    - `AssetManager.probeSpineState(window.NOTELEKS_LAST_SCENE)`
- Watch the console for diagnostic logs from `AssetManager` (it logs which candidates were queued and if animations were created).

7) Common pitfalls & fixes
- Noisy 404s: caused by `loadFrameSequence` probing beyond the actual frames (the code currently probes up to 16 indices by default). Fixes:
  - Ensure `frameCount` passed to `loadFrameSequence` is correct.
  - Prefer using a packed spritesheet/atlas in production.
  - Consider using a build-time manifest (see next section) to avoid runtime probing.
- Naming mismatches: exporter producing `_512` sidecar names vs runtime expecting no `_512`. The loader prefers `.webp` and no-`_512` variants but will try fallbacks.

8) Recommended next steps (developer workflow)
- Export Spine skeleton & atlas to `public/games/noteleks/spine/`.
- If you want per-frame images: export per-frame `.webp` files into `public/games/noteleks/sprites/` using the `Skeleton-<Anim>_<index>.webp` convention.
- Run `node tools/make_spritesheet.js` (or your repacking tool) to produce a packed spritesheet and JSON sidecar; place outputs under `public/games/noteleks/sprites/`.
- Start the dev server and open the game. Use `AssetManager.probeSpineState(window.NOTELEKS_LAST_SCENE)` to inspect what the loader found.

9) Long-term improvement (manifest)
- Best practice: generate a manifest at build-time that lists exact frame filenames for each animation (JSON). Have the runtime consume the manifest to enqueue exact files (no probing). This eliminates runtime HEAD calls and noisy 404s.

Notes: The repository already contains a spine README at `public/games/noteleks/spine/README.md` describing spine file placement and expected animation names. This `ANIMATIONS.md` focuses on the exporter/packer/loader contract and debugging steps for the Noteleks runtime.
